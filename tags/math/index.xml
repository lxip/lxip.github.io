      <description>Recently I start realising the decline of my math instinct. The other day, it took me a few minutes to remember the Gaussian sum and more minutes for the very basic Trigonometry. The only thing about calculation remains sharp in my mind is probably the Chinese multiplication table. I&amp;rsquo;m having a hard time to admit that it would be hard for me to pass a high school entrance math tests.</description>

      <description>I came across a question in codewars which is based on the calculation of the *n*th number in the Fabonacci sequence. Remember back in high school we were asked to derive this via MI, which is a long story. And thanks to the power of computation that gives options to simplify this process. Anyway, here are a few ways for solution:
1. Math function This is put at the first place because for people who do math it is the most intuitive action to just calculate the result from $$F_n = \frac{1}{sqrt(5)}\bigg[ \big(\frac{1+sqrt(5)}{2}\big)^n - \big(\frac{1-sqrt(5)}{2}\big)^n \bigg]$$ However, the calculation</description>
